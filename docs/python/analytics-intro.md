Types of Analytics

- Descriptive
	- what has happened?
	- Hindsight
	- Diagnostic analytics
		- Why did it happen?
- Predictive
	- What could happen in future?
	- prediction is based on past data
	- Insight
- Prescriptive
	- What should a business do?
	- How can we make it happen?
	- Foresight
	- This step is only can change the business
	- highest difficulty, highest value
	
	- has two parts
		- Decision support
		- Decision automation

Descriptive Example
	- summarizing past event such as regional sales, customer attrition or success of marketing campaigns
	- Tabulation of social metrics such as Fb, twitter
	- Reporting of general trends
	
	CCSE covid-19 dashboard - descriptive analytics
	
Predictive Example
	- Probably the lion may hunt and where
	- identify customers that are likely to abandon a service or  - also called churn analysis / churn prediction
	- send marketing campaigns to customers who are most likely to buy
	- improve customer service by planning appropriately
	
Prescriptive
	- Automate - fox put traps
	- Googles self driving car
	- Robotos
	- Flying drones
	
	
Examples:
	- Weather forecasting
	- Rain here and there
	- Why it happened? heat wave
	- What will happen in future
	
	
What is a failure model?
	- e.g. corona model
	- trend shows increasing
	- prediction will also be increasing
	- but the actual trend will NOT be increasing as the cure will reduce the number of cases

Machine learning - three parts

Supervised
	- based on labels
	- direct feedback
	- predict outcome/future
	- banana and apples example
	- banana - yellow and elongated
	- apples - red and oval
	- Real like example - spam mail / ham mail
	
	- predict continuous variable (regression)
	- predict discrete variables (spam or not, churn analysis etc)
	
Unsupervised
	- No label data
	- No feedback
	- Model learns based on classification
	- Customer segmentation in marketing
	
	Scenario - Example
		- going to walmart
		- customer buying soap also buys a teddy bear
		- how will you increase sales?
		- putting next to teddy bear
		- discount
		
	- customer segmentation
	
Reinforcement learning
	- Learning from reward / penality experience
	- Mouse, maze and food example
	- reward + penality for self driving cars
	- ping pong game
	- Decision process
	- Reward system
	- Learn series of actions
	
	
	- Game playing
	- Drone flying
