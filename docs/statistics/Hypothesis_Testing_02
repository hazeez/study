# Hypothesis Tests

In the previous article, we got introduced to the concept of hypothesis - null hypothesis and the alternate hypothesis. We concluded with how the _p-value_ is compared with the level of significance to either accept or reject the null hypothesis.

## Hypothesis test steps

Just to recap, hypothesis testing is _the process of determining whether a given hypothesis is true or not_

The highlight is on the word **process**. If it is called a process, then there have to be some steps associated.

The steps for testing the hypothesis are mentioned below

1. State the null hypothesis  $\mathbf{H}_\mathbf{0}$ and the alternate hypothesis $\mathbf{H}_\mathbf{1}$
2. Choose the level of significance
3. Find critical values
4. Find test statistic
5. Draw your conclusion

Ok. Sounds good! Let us take stock of what knowledge we have about the above-mentioned steps. 

We know what the null and the alternate hypothesis are, level of significance, and probably presume what draw your conclusion means.

What we don't know about is step 4 - Find critical values and step 5 - find test statistic.

Good! Let's see what a critical value is! 

To understand the critical value, we need to first understand what _one-tailed_ and _two-tailed_ tests are.

## One-Tailed and Two-Tailed

We have already seen tails in statistics - when there is a long tail to the right, the data is positively skewed and where is a long tail to the left, the data is negatively skewed.

So it has to do something with the distribution curve. Yes, you are right! 

Let's go step by step!

### What are tails?

In the normal context, we know tails are that extra portion that is attached to the body of an animal. 

Similarly, in the context of statistics, tails are that portion that is attached to the side of distribution - see figure below - _the grey area_

!!! Note
	Distribution does not have to have two tails always. There can be only one tail as well. 

Now that we have seen the tails, we understand things better.
But, there are two tails here - do we have names that distinguish between these tails?

### Upper tail and lower tail

#### Upper tail

Upper tail is towards the upper side i.e. the positive side of the graph. Remember positive values lie on the right. So it is called as "right-tail" also.

#### Lower tail

Lower tail is towards the lower side i.e the negative side of the graph. Hence it is referred to as "left-tail" as well.
