# Test statistic - $\chi^2$ & F

> In the [previous article](../hypothesis_testing_03), we saw what a Z test and t-test are! 
> Z test and t-test are used when the hypothesis test is about the **means** of the population.

In this article, let us see two tests - the chi-squared ($\chi^2$) and F test which tests the hypothesis about the **variance** of the population.

!!! Recall
	The sample estimate of the population variance is given by

	$$
			s^2 = \frac{\sum(x_i-\bar{x})^2}{n-1}
	$$
	where $s$ is the sample variance, $\bar{x}$ is the sample mean, and $n$ is the number of samples.

## Chi-squared statistic

$\chi^2$ is used to test the hypothesis about a single population variance.

### Formula

The formula for computing $\chi ^2$ is

$$
\chi ^2 = \frac{(n-1)s ^2}{\sigma ^2}
$$

where $df$ is the degree of freedom,  $s$ is the sample standard deviation and $\sigma$ is the population standard deviation and $n$ is the number of samples.

#### Interpretation of $\chi ^2$

 If the chi-square value is more than the critical value, then there is a significant difference in the variance between the sample and the population.

!!! Tip
	The Chi-square statistic can **only be used on numbers**. They canâ€™t be used for percentages, proportions, means or similar statistical value. For example, if you have 20 percent of 100 people, you would need to convert that to a number (20) before you can run a test statistic.

### Application of Chi-square

A manufacturing company produces bearings of 2.65 cm in diameter. A major customer requires that the variance in diameter be no more than 0.001 $cm ^2$. The manufacturer tests 20 bearings using a precise instrument and gets the below values. Assuming the diameters are normally distributed, can the population of these bearings be rejected due to high variance at 1% significance level.

#### Data
2.69, 2.66, 2.64, 2.59, 2.62, 2.63, 2.69, 2.66, 2.63, 2.65, 2.57, 2.63, 2.70, 2.71, 2.64, 2.65, 2.59, 2.66, 2.62, 2.57

### Solution approach

The problem talks about a single population variance. Hence, a $\chi ^2$ test can be used.

#### Known parameters

$sample \space size \space n = 20$

$level \space of \space  significance \space \alpha = 1\% \space  or \space  0.01$

$Degree \space of \space  freedom \space = n - 1 \space which \space is \space  20 - 1 \space = 19$

$population \space variance = \sigma ^2	= 0.001$

Let's follow the hypothesis testing process

1. State the null and the alternate hypothesis.

	The variance in diameter to be ==no more than== 0.001 $cm ^2$.
	
	So the null hypothesis is 
	
	$$
		 \mathbf{H}_\mathbf{0}: diameter \le 0.001
	$$
	
	and hence the alternate hypothesis is
	
	$$
		 \mathbf{H}_\mathbf{1} : diameter > 0.001
	$$
	
	Since the alternate hypothesis has the greater than symbol $>$, it is a chi-square ==right-tailed== test.

2. Find the level of significance
	
	The level of significance is already provided $\alpha = 0.05$
	
	!!! Tip
		If the level of significance is not provided, take the default $\alpha = 0.05$
	
3. Find the critical value
	
	The critical value is found out in the chi-squared table for $df = 19$ and $\alpha = 0.01$. 

	The critical value is ==36.191.== i.e $\chi ^2_c = 36.191$

4. Find the test statistic

	To find the test statistic, we will use the formula.

	$$
	\chi ^2 = \frac{(n-1)s ^2}{\sigma ^2}
	$$

	We don't know the sample variance $s ^2$ but, it can be computed by using the data provided.

	Copy the data in excel and use the formula `VAR.S` and get the value which in turn is $0.001621$.

	Substituting the values, we get

	$$
	\chi ^2 = \frac{19 *0.001621}{0.001}
	$$
	
	which gives

	$$
	\chi ^2 = 30.8
	$$

5. Draw the conclusion - to accept/reject the null hypothesis

	![](https://i.imgur.com/0SxM4Y0.png)
	
	Since the $\chi ^2 < \chi^2_{critical}$ i.e. $30.8 < 36.191$, we accept the null hypothesis.

	The bearings produced are within the specified limits required by the customer.

> To conclude, a $\chi ^2$ test (chi-squared) is used to test the hypothesis about a single population variance.

## F distribution

$\chi ^2$ is useful when testing hypothesis about a single population. 

What if we want to test the hypothesis about the difference in variances of two populations?

!!! Example
	Do parts manufactured on 2 different machines have the same variance or not?

### Formula

Since F-test is a comparison of variances of two different populations using samples collected from each population, we can say that it is the ratio of two sample variances i.e.

$$
F = \frac{s_1 ^2}{s_2 ^2} = \frac{est.\sigma ^2_1}{est.\sigma ^2_2}
$$

What does this formula mean?

We know that $s_1$ is the standard deviation of sample 1 and $s_2$ is the standard deviation of sample 2.

Since the F test is a comparison between two **variances**, we need to square the standard deviation. (Remember: variance = standard deviation$^2$)

#### Interpretation

Ideally, this F ratio should be about 1

-	if the 2 samples come from the same population
-	or the 2 samples come from a different population with the same variance

So if we compute the F ratio and see if the value is near to 1, it means two samples have the same variance thereby the population variance is also the same.

Bigger the F ratio - bigger the variance (or the two population is not related to each other)

!!! Important
	Since the F test/distribution deals with two samples, there will be two degrees of freedom - one for sample 1 and one for sample 2.

!!! Facts
	1.  The curve is not symmetrical but skewed to the right.
	2.  There is a different curve for each set of  _df_.
	3.  The  _F_  statistic is greater than or equal to zero.
	4.  As the degrees of freedom for the numerator and the denominator get larger, the curve approximates the normal.

### Application of the 'F' test

A machine produces metal sheets with 22mm thickness. There is a ==variability== in thickness due to machines, operators, manufacturing environment, raw material, etc. The company wants to know the consistency of ==two machines== and randomly samples 10 sheets from machine 1 and 12 sheets from machine 2. Thickness measurements are taken. Assume sheet thickness is normally distributed in the population.

The company wants to know if the variance for each sample comes from the same population variance (i.e. population variances are equal) or from different population variances (population variances are unequal).

#### Data provided

| Machine 1 | Machine 2 |
|-----------|-----------|
| 22.3      | 22.0      |
| 21.8      | 22.1      |
| 22.3      | 21.8      |
| 21.6      | 21.9      |
| 21.8      | 22.2      |
| 21.9      | 22.0      |
| 22.4      | 21.7      |
| 22.5      | 21.9      |
| 22.2      | 22.0      |
| 21.6      | 22.1      |
|           | 21.9      |
|           | 22.1      |

### Solution Approach

#### Understanding what type of test it is

Here the problem statement is about knowing the consistency of _two machines_ in terms of _variability_.

For variances test, we have two tests - $\chi ^2$ and F test. But since we have to compare two variances, we have to go with the F test.

#### Known parameters

$$
Samples \space from \space machine \space  one \space n_1  = 10 \\
Samples \space from \space machine \space  two \space n_2  = 12
$$

We have the data for machine 1 and machine 2 - from which we can find the variance - from excel

#### Compute the rest of the parameters

![](https://i.imgur.com/GEyw7ES.png)

We compute the variance and the count of samples.

![](https://i.imgur.com/xDhf34z.png)

The degree of freedom for machine 1 is 9 ($df_1 = n_1 - 1$).
The degree of freedom for machine 1 is 11 ($df_2 = n_2 - 1$).

#### Following the hypothesis testing process

There are 5 steps to the hypothesis testing process. Let's follow that one by one.

1. State the null and the alternate hypothesis
	
	Since this problem talks about variance in the two machines, the null hypothesis will be that there is no variance.

	$$
	 \mathbf{H}_\mathbf{0}: \sigma_1 ^2 = \sigma_2 ^2
	$$

	The alternate hypothesis will be
	
	$$
	 \mathbf{H}_\mathbf{0}: \sigma_1 ^2 \ne \sigma_2 ^2
	$$	

	So based on the symbol of the alternate hypothesis which is $\ne$, we conclude that this is a ==two-tailed== test.

	!!! Tip
		If there is any difficulty in stating the null hypothesis, start with the alternate hypothesis and then draft the null hypothesis.

2. Find the level of significance
	
	The level of significance $\alpha$ is not given and hence a $\alpha$ of 5% or 0.05 is presumed.

	Since this is a two-tailed test, we have to divide $\alpha$ by 2 which gives the value as 0.025.
	
3. Find the critical value
	
	Similar to tables for other tests, F tests also have a corresponding table called the F-table.

	The F-table has a degree of freedom one ($df_1$) on the 'x' axis and degree of freedom two ($df_2$) on the 'y' axis.

	Let's see the F table for $df_1 = 9$ and $df_2 = 11$ to find the critical value for F test. The critical value is $F_{0.025,9,11} = 3.5879$. 
	
	![](https://i.imgur.com/iq9ZRyX.png)

	This number is for the right-tail. Remember, we have a two-tails for this hypothesis testing.

	We also need to compute the left-tail critical value which can be either computed like the F-table above with a level of significance $\alpha = 0.975 (1-0.025 = 0.975)$ and the $df_1 = 9$ and $df_2 = 11$.

	The other method of doing this is to divide 1 by $F_{0.025,9,11}$
	
	$$
	F_{0.975,9,11} = \frac{1}{F_{0.025,9,11}}
	$$

	$$
	F_{0.975,9,11} = \frac{1}{3.5879} = 0.2787
	$$

4. Find the test statistic

	The test statistic is found by the F distribution formula - which is

	$$
	F = \frac{s_1 ^2}{s_2 ^2}
	$$

	So the F score is 5.62
	$$
	F_{score} = \frac{0.11378}{0.02023} = 5.62
	$$

5. Draw the conclusion

	From the above steps, we know that the $F_{critical} = 3.5879$ and the $F_{score} = 5.62$

	Since $F_{score}$ > $F_{critical}$ or in other words, falls into the rejection region, we reject the null hypothesis. 

	That is, the variance in Machine 1 and Machine 2 are not equal. Machine 1 has a higher variance and hence needs to be inspected for issues.

	The graph below illustrates the F score and the F critical value and why the null hypothesis is rejected.

## ANOVA

ANOVA - Analysis of Variance

ANOVA is used to analyze the means of the samples.

In the $\chi^2$ test, we saw how to compare variance within a single population and in the F test, we saw how to compare the variance between two samples of a single population / two population.

What if there are three or more samples? Can we find if they are from the same population? ANOVA test is used for this purpose.

When performing ANOVA test, we try to determine if the difference between the averages reflects a real difference between the groups, or is due to the random noise inside each group.

The groups here mean samples - say out of a Population p, we are taking three groups of samples - $n_1, n_2, n_3$.


### Assumptions in the ANOVA test

- The samples taken are independent; (taking samples in one group does not affect the probability of the samples taken in other groups)
- The population must be normally distributed.

### Null hypothesis and computation

Since we are comparing three groups or more, the null hypothesis of ANOVA would look like below

$$
 \mathbf{H}_\mathbf{0}: \mu_A = \mu_B = \mu_C
$$

We compute the F value and compare it with the critical value determined by the degrees of freedom. Here, the degrees of freedom are to be calculated for the groups and the number of items in each group.

### Example

Let's say we have three groups - A, B and C which have the below samples picked.

| Group A | Group B | Group C |
|---------|---------|---------|
| 37      | 62      | 50      |
| 60      | 27      | 63      |
| 52      | 69      | 58      |
| 43      | 64      | 54      |
| 40      | 43      | 49      |
| 52      | 54      | 52      |
| 55      | 44      | 53      |
| 39      | 31      | 43      |
| 39      | 49      | 65      |
| 23      | 57      | 43      |

These three groups have an equal number of samples.

The degree of freedom of the groups = $df_g = 3 - 1 = 2$.
The degree of freedom for the samples within each group is $df_s = 9 + 9 + 9 = 27$ i.e. $n-1$ for each group which is $10 - 1 = 9$

Let us calculate the mean of each of the groups and the total mean (which is total of all the means of the three groups divided by 3)

|            | Group A | Group B | Group C |
|-----------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
|            |    37   |    62   |    50   |
|            |    60   |    27   |    63   |
|            |    52   |    69   |    58   |
|            |    43   |    64   |    54   |
|            |    40   |    43   |    49   |
|            |    52   |    54   |    52   |
|            |    55   |    44   |    53   |
|            |    39   |    31   |    43   |
|            |    39   |    49   |    65   |
|            |    23   |    57   |    43   |
|       Mean |    **44**   |    **50**   |    **53**   |
| Mean Total |    **49**   |         |         |

!!! Important
	ANOVA considers two types of variance
	
	- Between groups
		- How far each group mean vary from the total mean (i.e. in this case, how $44, 50, 53$ vary from the total mean $49$
		
	- Within groups
		- How far individual values vary from their respective group mean.

!!! Note
	We will compute the F score both manually as well as using excel. If you want to move on with excel computation only, you may skip the below section and can proceed with computation with excel (using data-analysis addin) only.

### Formula

We compute F value for the groups which is the ratio between the two variances - i.e. variance between groups and variance within groups

$$
F = \frac{Variance\space Between\space Groups}{Variance\space Within\space Groups}
$$

!!! Recall
	We know that the formula for variance is
	$$
	s ^2 = \frac{\sum(x - \bar{x}) ^2}{n -1} = \frac{SS}{df}
    $$
    where $\sum(x - \bar{x}) ^2$ is the _sum of squares_ $SS$ and the $n -1$ is the _degree of freedom_.

So the formula for the f value becomes

$$
F = \frac{VarianceBetweenGroups}{VarianceWithinGroups} = \frac{\frac{SSG}{df_{groups}}}{\frac{SSE}{df_{error}}}
$$

where $SSG$ = Sum of squares groups, $df_{groups} =$ degrees of freedom (groups) and
$SSE$ = Sum of squares error and $df_{error}$ = degrees of freedom (error)

### Solution approach

As with any hypothesis testing, let us perform the calculation using the hypothesis testing steps.

1. State the null and the alternate hypothesis

	For ANOVA, the hypothesis will always be - the means across different groups will be equal.	
	In this case, the means of the groups will be equal is the null hypothesis.

	$$
		 \mathbf{H}_\mathbf{0}: \mu_A = \mu_B = \mu_C
	$$
	
	The alternate hypothesis will be $\mathbf{H}_\mathbf{1}: \mu_A \ne \mu_B \ne \mu_C$

	!!! Important
		In ANOVA, there will be NO two-tailed test. ANOVA will ALWAYS be one-tailed and that will be ==upper-tailed only==. Why?
		We know that in the formula, we are dividing the sum of squares between groups and within groups which would always yield a positive value and hence it will always be _upper tailed_.

2. Find the level of significance

	Here level of significance is not provided; we will take the default $\alpha = 0.05$

3. Find the critical value
	
	We know that the two degrees of freedom - for the groups and within the groups are 2 and 27 respectively. So, $df_1 = 2$ and $df_2 = 27$

	Looking into the F table (for ANOVA) at 0.05 significance level, we get the $F_{critical}$	value as $3.35$ (see image below)

	![](https://i.imgur.com/B0ucElO.png)

4. Find the test statistic

	To compute it manually, we will be using excel. The following screenshot shows how it is done.

We know the formula is

$$
F = \frac{VarianceBetweenGroups}{VarianceWithinGroups} = \frac{\frac{SSG}{df_{groups}}}{\frac{SSE}{df_{error}}}
$$

#### Computing the sum of squares within groups and between groups manually.
	
![](https://i.imgur.com/fZLQycd.png)

substituting in the formula, we get

$$
F_{test} = \frac{\frac{420}{2}}{\frac{3300}{27}} = 1.718
$$

#### Computing the sum of squares within groups and between groups via excel data-analysis addin.

1. Enter the data in excel

	![](https://i.imgur.com/a87UPqd.png)
	
2. Go to Data -> Data Analysis and select "Anova - Single factor" and click "OK"
	
	![](https://i.imgur.com/qhJSZ3w.png)
		
3. Give the input range, check "labels in first row" as we have the group headers in the first row and input the level of significance. Click "OK"

	![](https://i.imgur.com/q0stppA.png)

4. We get the analysis in a new sheet.

	![](https://i.imgur.com/I1AhY5O.png)
	
5. Draw your conclusion
	
	Here we see that the $F_{score}$ is less than the $F_{critical}$ ($1.718 < 3.354$) and hence we will accept the null hypothesis - which means that there is no difference between the means of any group.

## Summary

To summarize, we have seen two tests - the chi-square and the F test to test the variances in the population.

We have also seen ANOVA - which is used to test the hypothesis when more than two groups of samples are picked from the population.
