The topic in question is - Is normal distribution a probability distribution? Yes, it is and this writeup provides justification as to why it is so! Revisiting the Normal distribution Let's revisit the normal distribution once - its characteristics and emprical rule Normal distribution is the distribution of data that is symmetric over the mean. 50% of the data lie to the left and 50% of the data lie to the right At the origin, mean = median = mode = 0 Emprical rule The emprical rule states that - 68% of the data will be within one standard deviation of the mean - 95% of the data will be within two standard deviations from the mean - 99.7% of the data will be within three standard deviations from the mean Lets see that in the figure below Example Dataset Let's plot a normal distribution graph of 300 people with a mean salary of 50,000 and standard deviation of 8700 (sigma) Descriptive Statistics Value Mean 50000 Median 50000 Std dev p 8700 Mode 50000 Then the following will be the ranges of the salary from the mean. Sigma Range Salary -1 sigma 41300 +1 sigma 58700 -2 sigma 32600 +2 sigma 67400 -3 sigma 23900 +3 sigma 76100 The number of people with the respective salary range and the normal distribution is mentioned below.

Random sample Let's take a random sample from our range of salaries. NOTE: use the EXCEL RANDBETWEEN function to generate a random sample provided a range. Here our range is from -3 sigma to +3 sigma which is from 23900 to 76100 The random sample i.e. salary taken is 47243 Question? What is the chance that this random sample (e.g. 47243 ) falls within -3 sigma to +3 sigma? i.e. the area under the curve (highlighted in red color)? Can we say that 99.7% of the time of the time the random sample taken will fall within the -3 sigma to +3 sigma (i.e. the area under the curve) This 99.7% chance is called as the probability of the sample falling within the range -3 sigma to +3 sigma. The range of Probability is from 0 to 1 . i.e 0 for no chance and 1 for 100% chance. One more sample Let's take one more sample between -3 sigma and +3 sigma. What is the chance that it will fall under the area of the curve highlighted below (in red color) i.e. from -1 sigma to +1 sigma? Can we say that it will be 68% or 0.68 probability? Lets prove it! The area under the chart is from -1 sigma to +1 sigma. Correct? Let's revisit Z (zee) scores once z scores is the number of units of standard deviation from the mean. Here the range in consideration is -1 sigma to +1 sigma i.e we want to find out if a random sample (salary) falls within this range. So the z scores are -1 and +1 . To be precise we can say -1.0 and +1.0 Let's bring Z-Tables. Z-Tables provides us the area under the curve / probability. Using Z-tables lets find the area under the curve of -1.0Z Since -1 is a negative Z, we see the negative Z score table and see that the probability is 0.15866 (see figure below) i.e if we take a random sample between -3 sigma and +3 sigma, the chance of the random sample falling under the area of the curve of -1Z is 15.866% . Thus Z tables us gives the probability. For +1Z , let's refer to the positive Z score table. The area under the curve is 0.84134 . (See fig below). To summarize, to find out the area under the curve -1Z to +1Z , we need to subtract the area under +1Z with -1Z Note: Zee is 1 unit of standard deviation. So it is -1 sigma to +1 sigma i.e 0.84134 - 0.15866 = 0.68268 . Thus 68.268% is the probability that a given random sample will fall under the range of -1 sigma to +1 sigma. In this way, we can find out the probability of a random variable falling under the area of the curve of the normal distribution for any Zee values. i.e from -3 sigma to -2 sigma. or from -2 sigma to +3 sigma etc. Conclusion Thus we have emprically concluded that the normal distribution is a probability distribution as it helps to find the probability of a random variable falling within the normal distribution range.","title":"Exercise05"},{"location":"exercises/exercise05/#normal_distribution_is_a_probability_distribution","text":"The topic in question is - Is normal distribution a probability distribution?

Confidence Interval A confidence interval is the range of numbers that is believed to include an unknown population parameter. Confidence Level It is the measure of confidence that the unknown parameter (of the population) lies within the confidence interval. A case study Comcast, the computer services company, is planning to invest heavily in online television service. As part of the decision, the company wants to estimate the average number of online shows a family of four would watch per day. A random sample of 100 families is obtained, and in this sample the average number of shows viewed per day is 6.5 and the population standard deviation is known to be 3.2 . Construct a 95% confidence interval for the average number of online television shows watched by the entire population of families of four. Known measures sample size - $$ n = 100 $$ sample mean - $$ \\bar{x} = 6.5 $$ population standard deviation - $$ \\sigma = 3.2 $$ confidence interval $$ Z = 1.96 (for the value of 95 percent) $$ To be found: Confidence interval of within which the population mean i.e. the average number of online television shows are watched by the entire population Let's picturize it Let's understand the picture Let's compute the confidence interval Confidence interval = \\mu \\pm Z * (\\sigma / \\sqrt n) \\mu \\pm Z * (\\sigma / \\sqrt n) Since we don't know the population parameter $$ \\mu $$ here, we will replace it with the value we know about the sample i.e. the sample mean $$ \\bar{x} $$ So the confidence interval in this case is $$ \\bar{x} \\pm Z * (\\sigma / \\sqrt n) $$ When substituted with values above, we get $$ confidence interval = 6.5 \\pm 1.96 * (3.2 / \\sqrt(100) $$ Note: The Z value for 95% confidence is 1.96 We get the confidence interval as [5.8728, 7.1272] If we reduce the confidence level to 80%, what happens? Note: the Z score for 80% confidence is 1.282 $$ confidence interval = 6.5 \\pm 1.28 * (3.2 / \\sqrt(100) $$ The confidence interval becomes [6.0904, 6.9096] Inference So, when the confidence level decreases from 95% to 80%, the confidence interval becomes narrorwer - which would mean our chance of finding the population mean reduces by 15% So it is better to always have a high confidence level to get more accurate estimations of the population mean What if i need to have a good confidence level i.e. 95% but the confidence interval should be narrower to get closer to the population mean - more accuracy in predicting? Answer Increase the sample size i.e. increase the sample size n=100 provided above to n=200 . The confidence interval becomes [6.0565, 6.9434]","title":"Exercise06"},{"location":"exercises/exercise06/#confidence_level_vs_the_accuracy_of_estimation_of_the_population_mean","text":"Does the more the confidence level in the confidence interval mean more the accurate prediction of the estimation of the population mean?","title":"Confidence level Vs the accuracy of estimation of the population mean"},{"location":"exercises/exercise06/#confidence_interval","text":"A confidence interval is the range of numbers that is believed to include an unknown population parameter.","title":"Confidence Interval"},{"location":"exercises/exercise06/#confidence_level","text":"It is the measure of confidence that the unknown parameter (of the population) lies within the confidence interval.","title":"Confidence Level"},{"location":"exercises/exercise06/#a_case_study","text":"Comcast, the computer services company, is planning to invest heavily in online television service.
