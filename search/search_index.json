The topic in question is - Is normal distribution a probability distribution? Yes, it is and this writeup provides justification as to why it is so! Revisiting the Normal distribution Let's revisit the normal distribution once - its characteristics and emprical rule Normal distribution is the distribution of data that is symmetric over the mean. 50% of the data lie to the left and 50% of the data lie to the right At the origin, mean = median = mode = 0 Emprical rule The emprical rule states that - 68% of the data will be within one standard deviation of the mean - 95% of the data will be within two standard deviations from the mean - 99.7% of the data will be within three standard deviations from the mean Lets see that in the figure below Example Dataset Let's plot a normal distribution graph of 300 people with a mean salary of 50,000 and standard deviation of 8700 (sigma) Descriptive Statistics Value Mean 50000 Median 50000 Std dev p 8700 Mode 50000 Then the following will be the ranges of the salary from the mean. Sigma Range Salary -1 sigma 41300 +1 sigma 58700 -2 sigma 32600 +2 sigma 67400 -3 sigma 23900 +3 sigma 76100 The number of people with the respective salary range and the normal distribution is mentioned below.

Random sample Let's take a random sample from our range of salaries. NOTE: use the EXCEL RANDBETWEEN function to generate a random sample provided a range. Here our range is from -3 sigma to +3 sigma which is from 23900 to 76100 The random sample i.e. salary taken is 47243 Question? What is the chance that this random sample (e.g. 47243 ) falls within -3 sigma to +3 sigma? i.e. the area under the curve (highlighted in red color)? Can we say that 99.7% of the time of the time the random sample taken will fall within the -3 sigma to +3 sigma (i.e. the area under the curve) This 99.7% chance is called as the probability of the sample falling within the range -3 sigma to +3 sigma. The range of Probability is from 0 to 1 . i.e 0 for no chance and 1 for 100% chance. One more sample Let's take one more sample between -3 sigma and +3 sigma. What is the chance that it will fall under the area of the curve highlighted below (in red color) i.e. from -1 sigma to +1 sigma? Can we say that it will be 68% or 0.68 probability? Lets prove it! The area under the chart is from -1 sigma to +1 sigma. Correct? Let's revisit Z (zee) scores once z scores is the number of units of standard deviation from the mean. Here the range in consideration is -1 sigma to +1 sigma i.e we want to find out if a random sample (salary) falls within this range. So the z scores are -1 and +1 . To be precise we can say -1.0 and +1.0 Let's bring Z-Tables. Z-Tables provides us the area under the curve / probability. Using Z-tables lets find the area under the curve of -1.0Z Since -1 is a negative Z, we see the negative Z score table and see that the probability is 0.15866 (see figure below) i.e if we take a random sample between -3 sigma and +3 sigma, the chance of the random sample falling under the area of the curve of -1Z is 15.866% . Thus Z tables us gives the probability. For +1Z , let's refer to the positive Z score table. The area under the curve is 0.84134 . (See fig below). To summarize, to find out the area under the curve -1Z to +1Z , we need to subtract the area under +1Z with -1Z Note: Zee is 1 unit of standard deviation. So it is -1 sigma to +1 sigma i.e 0.84134 - 0.15866 = 0.68268 . Thus 68.268% is the probability that a given random sample will fall under the range of -1 sigma to +1 sigma. In this way, we can find out the probability of a random variable falling under the area of the curve of the normal distribution for any Zee values. i.e from -3 sigma to -2 sigma. or from -2 sigma to +3 sigma etc. Conclusion Thus we have emprically concluded that the normal distribution is a probability distribution as it helps to find the probability of a random variable falling within the normal distribution range.","title":"Exercise05"},{"location":"exercises/exercise05/#normal_distribution_is_a_probability_distribution","text":"The topic in question is - Is normal distribution a probability distribution?

Confidence Interval A confidence interval is the range of numbers that is believed to include an unknown population parameter. Confidence Level It is the measure of confidence that the unknown parameter (of the population) lies within the confidence interval. A case study Comcast, the computer services company, is planning to invest heavily in online television service. As part of the decision, the company wants to estimate the average number of online shows a family of four would watch per day. A random sample of 100 families is obtained, and in this sample the average number of shows viewed per day is 6.5 and the population standard deviation is known to be 3.2 . Construct a 95% confidence interval for the average number of online television shows watched by the entire population of families of four. Known measures sample size - $$ n = 100 $$ sample mean - $$ \\bar{x} = 6.5 $$ population standard deviation - $$ \\sigma = 3.2 $$ confidence interval $$ Z = 1.96 (for the value of 95 percent) $$ To be found: Confidence interval of within which the population mean i.e. the average number of online television shows are watched by the entire population Let's picturize it Let's understand the picture Let's compute the confidence interval Confidence interval = \\mu \\pm Z * (\\sigma / \\sqrt n) \\mu \\pm Z * (\\sigma / \\sqrt n) Since we don't know the population parameter $$ \\mu $$ here, we will replace it with the value we know about the sample i.e. the sample mean $$ \\bar{x} $$ So the confidence interval in this case is $$ \\bar{x} \\pm Z * (\\sigma / \\sqrt n) $$ When substituted with values above, we get $$ confidence interval = 6.5 \\pm 1.96 * (3.2 / \\sqrt(100) $$ Note: The Z value for 95% confidence is 1.96 We get the confidence interval as [5.8728, 7.1272] If we reduce the confidence level to 80%, what happens? Note: the Z score for 80% confidence is 1.282 $$ confidence interval = 6.5 \\pm 1.28 * (3.2 / \\sqrt(100) $$ The confidence interval becomes [6.0904, 6.9096] Inference So, when the confidence level decreases from 95% to 80%, the confidence interval becomes narrorwer - which would mean our chance of finding the population mean reduces by 15% So it is better to always have a high confidence level to get more accurate estimations of the population mean What if i need to have a good confidence level i.e. 95% but the confidence interval should be narrower to get closer to the population mean - more accuracy in predicting? Answer Increase the sample size i.e. increase the sample size n=100 provided above to n=200 . The confidence interval becomes [6.0565, 6.9434]","title":"Exercise06"},{"location":"exercises/exercise06/#confidence_level_vs_the_accuracy_of_estimation_of_the_population_mean","text":"Does the more the confidence level in the confidence interval mean more the accurate prediction of the estimation of the population mean?","title":"Confidence level Vs the accuracy of estimation of the population mean"},{"location":"exercises/exercise06/#confidence_interval","text":"A confidence interval is the range of numbers that is believed to include an unknown population parameter.","title":"Confidence Interval"},{"location":"exercises/exercise06/#confidence_level","text":"It is the measure of confidence that the unknown parameter (of the population) lies within the confidence interval.","title":"Confidence Level"},{"location":"exercises/exercise06/#a_case_study","text":"Comcast, the computer services company, is planning to invest heavily in online television service.

First let us understand what does the word hypothesis mean. Let us break the word into two parts hypo + thesis . What does thesis mean? thesis means something that has already been proven to be true. e.g Atleast 60% of the adult human body is made up of water. Sounds fine! So what does hypothesis mean? Hypothesis is something that is not yet been proven to be true. Let's come back to the original question! What is hypothesis testing? Can we say that it is the testing of hypothesis or more precisely the process of determining whether a given hypothesis is true or not To sum up, we take the hypothesis, we perform some statistical computations and prove if the hypothesis holds true or not. Null Hypothesis & Alternate Hypothesis Null hypothesis is the assertion or belief that we hold as true unless we have sufficient evidence to prove otherwise. In statistical terms, we say it as the belief we hold about the value of a population parameter Remember Parameter is for the population and Statistic is for the sample Let's take an example and see what is the null hypothesis and how it is written. We believe that the mean of the population is 500 . Unless we obtain sufficient evidence that it is not 500 , our belief holds true i.e we accept that the mean is 500 So we can write it as null hypothesis: mean = 500 To write it more compactly, we can represent the same thing as \\mathbf{H}_\\mathbf{0} : \\mu = 500 \\mathbf{H}_\\mathbf{0} : \\mu = 500 where the symbol \\space\\mathbf{H}_\\mathbf{0} \\space\\mathbf{H}_\\mathbf{0} denotes Null hypothesis. The opposite of Null hypothesis is called as Alternate Hypothesis . That is, the negation of the null hypothesis. If there is a way to represent the null hypothesis, then there should be a way to represent the alternate hypothesis. Agreed? Ah, I see I have quoted a null hypothesis there! \\mathbf{H}_\\mathbf{1}: \\mu \\ne 500 \\mathbf{H}_\\mathbf{1}: \\mu \\ne 500 where the symbol \\space\\mathbf{H}_\\mathbf{1} \\space\\mathbf{H}_\\mathbf{1} denotes alternate hypothesis Note Since the null hypothesis and the alternate hypothesis are exactly opposite statements, only one can be true. Rejecting one is accepting the other. Let's check our understanding with a few examples Example 1 My broadband company claims that the minimum internet speed they are providing is 150 Mbps. However, I suspect that they are not providing the promised internet speed. Let's write the null and alternate hypothesis for this! \\mathbf{H}_\\mathbf{0}: speed \\ge 150 Mbps \\\\ \\mathbf{H}_\\mathbf{1}: speed < 150 Mbps \\mathbf{H}_\\mathbf{0}: speed \\ge 150 Mbps \\\\ \\mathbf{H}_\\mathbf{1}: speed < 150 Mbps Example 2 The project manager claims that the software defects raised are resolved within 5 business days. I being the quality department manager think it is taking longer to fix the bugs. Can we write the null and alternate hypothesis for this? \\mathbf{H}_\\mathbf{0}: Resolution\\space period \\le 5 days \\\\ \\mathbf{H}_\\mathbf{1}: Resolution\\space period > 5 days \\mathbf{H}_\\mathbf{0}: Resolution\\space period \\le 5 days \\\\ \\mathbf{H}_\\mathbf{1}: Resolution\\space period > 5 days Let's see how we can prove the alternate hypothesis Example 1 To check the internet speed, I visit Speed Test from my home computer and measure the speed. I do this 'n' number of times and find that the mean speed is around 100 Mbps. So we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternate hypothesis - which is the internet speed is less than 150 Mbps Example 2 To verify the claims of the project manager, I take all of the 5 projects managed by him. He is relatively new to the project manager role and has only managed 5 projects so far. I get the bug details from the bug tracking system - bugzilla / jira for example. I compute the mean of all the bug resolution time by doing some computations ( calculate the difference between the bug start date and bug end date and so on). I find that the resolution time is indeed less than 5 days. So we accept the null hypothesis here i.e. resolution time is less than or equal to 5 business days. Wow, Hypothesis testing is very easy! Life is not easy always, Isn't it? In the above two cases, taking the samples was easy and our agreement / rejection of the null hypothesis was indeed accurate. In real life scenarios, we need to estimate a population parameter based on the sample and things might go wrong. That is to say, we might reject the null hypothesis when it is actually true or we might accept the null hypothesis when it is otherwise. This depends on the sample we take and if we don't have enough samples things might go wrong. Say for example, the null hypothesis states that the mean of the population is greater than or equal to 500 i.e. \\mathbf{H}_\\mathbf{0}: \\mu \\ge 500 \\mathbf{H}_\\mathbf{0}: \\mu \\ge 500 and the alternate hypothesis is mean less than 500 \\mathbf{H}_\\mathbf{1}: \\mu < 500 \\mathbf{H}_\\mathbf{1}: \\mu < 500 We took a sample size of 30 i.e n=30 and found the mean is 499 . Ah! now comes the dilemma - whether we need to accept or reject the null hypothesis? The sample mean is just falling short by 1 from the population mean. We go into self-doubt if we have taken the correct sample size or what happens if the sample size is increased or worst case, should I have to repeat the experiment once again and my manager fires me for wasting the time and effort? So, what we are contemplating here is the probability of the evidence (sample picked) being unfavorable to the null hypothesis. This probablility is called as the p-value If we say the p_value or probability is 2% , it means that our sample has 2% chances of going wrong in rejecting the null hypothesis. If we say the p_value or probability is 30% , it means that our sample has 30% chances of going wrong in rejecting the null hypothesis and our chances of getting a promotion will be adversely impacted. But, we are humans and we need to have a leeway (a threshold) for making some mistakes / error with the samples. This threshold is called as the level of significance In other words, level of significance is the maximum level of risk (maximum acceptable probability - in statistical terms) that we may take in rejecting the null hypothesis while the null hypothesis is actually true. Level of significance is denoted by the letter \\space\\alpha \\space\\alpha (alpha) alpha is normally represented as 1% or 5% or 10% etc. Let's consolidate our understanding! if the p-value is less than the level of significance , we reject the null hypothesis. if the p-value is greater than the level of significance , we accept the null hypothesis. Confused? Yeah, it happened with me. If not, I salute you. Proof for the 1 st statement Let's say the p-value is 2% and the level of significance is 5% . What does this mean? It means the probability of getting our samples wrong is 2% but the maximum risk that we can take is 5% . Correct? Remember our quest is always to prove the null hypothesis is wrong . In this case, our samples are within the permissible limits of going wrong and hence we reject the null hypothesis. Proof for the 2 nd statement Let's say the p-value is 10% and the level of significance is 5% . What does this mean? It means the probability of getting our samples wrong is 10% but the maximum risk that we can take is 5% . Correct? In this case, our samples are above the permissible limits of going wrong and hence we cannot reject the null hypothesis and have to accept the null hypothesis. Confidence level When the null hypothesis is rejected with a level of significance of 5% , we may be questioned of how confident we are in rejecting the null hypothesis In other words, it is to say that what is our confidence level in rejecting the null hypothesis. The relationship between confidence level and the level of significance is given by the relation confidence \\space level = (1 - \\alpha) \\\\ confidence \\space level = (1 - \\alpha) \\\\ which in this case is confidence \\space level = (1 - 0.05) \\space = 0.95 confidence \\space level = (1 - 0.05) \\space = 0.95 So that is we need to have atleast 95% confidence level to reject the null hypothesis. Summary To summarize, we have seen what is hypothesis, what is a null hypothesis, what is an alternate hypothesis and when hypothesis testing can go wrong. In the class, we have not seen the level of significance in detail and what important role it has in hypothesis testing. The last part of the article was included to make this grey area more clearer.","title":"Hypothesis Testing"},{"location":"statistics/Hypothesis_Testing_01/#hypothesis_testing_-_part_1","text":"","title":"Hypothesis Testing - Part 1"},{"location":"statistics/Hypothesis_Testing_01/#what_is_hypothesis_testing","text":"First let us understand what does the word hypothesis mean.
